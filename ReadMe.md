# Feature Engineering Tutorial: From Raw to Refined

This project demonstrates core techniques in feature engineering using a synthetic dataset. It compares model performance before and after engineering steps to show the practical impact on machine learning outcomes.

## üìÅ Contents
S
- `feature_engineering_tutorial.ipynb`: Main notebook with full walkthrough of feature transformations and model evaluation
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions
- `requirements.txt`: Python packages needed to run the tutorial
- `tutorial.docx` or `tutorial.pdf`: Optional academic write-up for submission
- `LICENSE`: Optional open-source license

## üß† Learning Objectives

- Understand why feature engineering is critical to model performance
- Apply common transformations such as:
  - Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding
  - Binning and Log Transformations
  - Scaling (MinMax)
  - Polynomial and Interaction Features
- Compare model performance before and after applying transformations
